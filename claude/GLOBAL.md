## Development Workflow
This is the workflow you should follow when building software.
- Plan
  - We'll use your built in planning mode.
- Build
  - Be thoughtful and thorough.
- Manual testing
  - All functional changes must be manually verified, even small changes.
- Automated testing
  - All changes need to be backed by automated tests.
- Self-review
  - Once your work is complete, carefully review the changes you've made.

## Documentation
- If making API changes, make sure to update the API documentation.
- Comments can be helpful when it's hard to make the code fully clear on its own. However, generally, adding comments should be unnecessary.

## Git
- Don't commit your changes. A human will commit your changes after reviewing them.

## Files
- Whenever you reference a file, use the full path (relative to the project root); this makes it easier for me to open it in my editor.

## Tasks/Issues
- If a Linear issue is referenced, you can view it by using the `linear_fetch_issue` bash command. Linear issue IDs look like `DEV-7892`.
