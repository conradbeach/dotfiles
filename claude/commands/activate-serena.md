Activate the project

## Instructions
- Active the project with the Serena MCP if it hasn't already been done.
  - Make sure you activate the project for the current working directory. Run `pwd` to check.
  I use Git worktrees and regularly Serena accidentally activates the base directory instead of the Git worktree directory.
- Perform onboarding with the Serena MCP if it hasn't already been done.
