Build a feature from the plan

## Instructions
Your task is to execute the development plan we've created in `Plan_from_Claude.md`.
You created this plan earlier. If you find a problem with the plan, of course feel free
to make the necessary changes, but also bear in mind that the plan has been well thought through.

- Create small, atomic commits as you go.
- Every commit should have tests for the changes. Don't commit untested code. Use the `rails-automated-testing-specialist`.
- For every commit, run linters.
- Once you're confident the requirements of the plan are fully met and your changes are well tested, execute `chp` to run the project checks and confirm everything looks good.
- If everything looks good, you're done. A human will review your changes.
