## Instructions
Your task is to build the feature described in the requirements below from start to finish.

- Use the Opus model for all your work.
- Think hard and be thorough in your planned solution. Make sure you're searching the
codebase for relevant information to confirm that your approach is correct.
- Make sure your solution meets all the requirements.
- Ensure your solution is secure.
- ALL changes must be tested. Either by updating existing tests or adding new ones.
- If making API changes, make sure to update the documentation.
- If making visual front-end changes, take a screenshot with Playwright and make sure the UI looks good. Iterate 2-3 times if needed until youâ€™re happy with it.
- NEVER commit your changes. A human will commit your changes after reviewing them.
- Once you're confident the requirements are fully met and your changes are well tested, run `chp` to run the project checks and confirm everything looks good.
- If everything looks good, you're done. A human will review your changes.
