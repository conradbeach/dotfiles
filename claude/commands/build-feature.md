Build a feature end to end.

## Instructions
Your task is to build the feature described in the requirements below from start to finish.

Before beginning, if you're given a Linear issue, fetch the Linear issue using the MCP server. Fetch any
comments in the issue as well. This will provide you with the context you need to implement the issue correctly.

After you have the requirements, investigate the current state of the system
related to the feature we're building. Put what you find in a `CURRENT_STATE.md` file.
Be succinct in your description of the current state.

After you understand the current state, create a plan for how you will implement the feature.
Put this plan in `PLAN.md`. Be succinct in your description of the plan.

At this point, pause for a human to review and approve your plan.

Once a human has told you your plan is good, implement the feature according to the plan.
- Create small, atomic commits as you go.
- Every commit should have tests for the changes. Don't commit untested code. Use the `rails-automated-testing-specialist`.
- For every commit, run linters.
- Once you're confident the requirements are fully met and your changes are well tested, execute `chp` to run the project checks and confirm everything looks good.
- If everything looks good, you're done. A human will review your changes.
