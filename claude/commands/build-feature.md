Build a feature end to end.

## Instructions
Your task is to build the feature described in the requirements below from start to finish.

Before beginning, if you're given a Linear issue, fetch the Linear issue using the MCP server. Fetch any
comments in the issue as well. This will provide you with the context you need to implement the issue correctly.

- Think hard and be thorough in your planned solution.
- Make sure you're searching the codebase for relevant information to confirm that your approach is correct.
- Consider if there are better solutions than what way me described in the requirements. Suggestions for better solutions are always appreciated!
- Ensure your solution is well thought through and handles edge cases.
- Use the Context7 MCP server to look up any documentation you might need.
- Make sure your solution meets all the requirements.
- Ensure your solution is secure.
- Consider whether or not your changes would be best placed behind a feature flag.
- Plan how you will write automated tests for the changes. All changes must be tested.
- If making API changes, make sure to update the documentation.
- If making visual front-end changes, take a screenshot with Playwright and make sure the UI looks good. Iterate 2-3 times if needed until youâ€™re happy with it.
- Manually test your changes through the web browser or by manually making API requests.
- Create small, atomic commits as you go.
- Every commit should have tests for the changes. Don't commit untested code. Use the `rails-automated-testing-specialist`.
- For every commit, run linters.
- Once you're confident the requirements are fully met and your changes are well tested, execute `chp` to run the project checks and confirm everything looks good.
- Once you've finished making changes, have the `code-reviewer` sub agent review all of your changes and make additional adjustments based on their feedback.
- If everything looks good, you're done. A human will review your changes.
