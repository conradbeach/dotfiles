Implement a feature based on a previously created plan.

## Instructions
Your task is to implement the feature described in the `PLAN.md` file. The plan in this file has already been reviewed and approved by a human.

- Think carefully as you proceed with the implementation. Ensure it's well thought through and handles edge cases.
- ALL changes must be tested. Use the `rails-automated-testing-specialist`.
- If making API changes, make sure to update the documentation.
- If making visual front-end changes, take a screenshot with Playwright and make sure the UI looks good. Iterate 2-3 times if needed until youâ€™re happy with it.
- Manually test your changes through the web browser or by manually making API requests.
- Do not commit your changes. A human will commit your changes after reviewing them.
- Once you're confident the requirements in `PLAN.md` are fully met and your changes are well tested, run `chp` to run the project checks and confirm everything looks good.
- Once you've finished making changes, have the `code-reviewer` sub agent review all of your changes and make additional adjustments based on their feedback.
- If everything looks good, you're done. A human will review your changes.
