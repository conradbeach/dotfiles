Complete a Linear issue.

## Instructions
Your task is to build the feature described in the Linear issue given below from start to finish.

Before beginning, fetch the Linear issue using the MCP server. Fetch any
comments in the issue as well. This will provide you with the context you need
to implement the issue correctly.

- Think hard and be thorough in your planned solution.
- Make sure you're searching the codebase for relevant information to confirm that your approach is correct.
- Ensure your solution is well thought through and handles edge cases.
- Use the Context7 MCP server to look up any documentation you might need.
- Make sure your solution meets all the requirements.
- Ensure your solution is secure.
- Consider whether or not your changes would be best placed behind a feature flag.
- Plan how you will write automated tests for the changes. All changes must be tested. Either by updating existing tests or adding new ones.
- If making API changes, make sure to update the documentation.
- If making visual front-end changes, take a screenshot with Playwright and make sure the UI looks good. Iterate 2-3 times if needed until youâ€™re happy with it.
- Manually test your changes through the web browser or by manually making API requests.
- Do not commit your changes. A human will commit your changes after reviewing them.
- Once you're confident the requirements are fully met and your changes are well tested, execute `chp` to run the project checks and confirm everything looks good.
- If everything looks good, you're done. A human will review your changes.
