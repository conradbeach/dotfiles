Explain the context around a feature/change

## Instructions
Please take a look at the requirements given below and investigate the current state of the system
related to the feature we're building or the changes we're making. I want to understand any existing
code, flows or architecture that might inform how I implement the given feature/changes.

If you're given a Linear issue, fetch the Linear issue using the MCP server. Fetch
any comments in the issue as well.

Use the @agent-Explore to explore the codebase as needed.

I'm not asking you to provide guidance on implementation, just provide context
that you think is relevant and helpful to be aware of before I begin my implementation.

Be succinct in your explanation.

Put your explanation in a `Context_from_Claude.md` file.
