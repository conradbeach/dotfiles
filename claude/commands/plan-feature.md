Create a plan to implement a feature/change

## Instructions
Your task is to create a plan to implement the feature described in the requirements below.

If you're given a Linear issue, fetch the Linear issue using the `linear_fetch_issue` bash command.

- Review @Context_from_Claude.md if it exists; this file was created during a
previous research phase you did and provides helpful context for the work we're doing.
- Think hard and be thorough in your planned solution. Make sure you're searching the
codebase for relevant information to confirm that your approach is correct.
- Ensure you're considering higher level architecture when deciding on your approach.
- Use the Context7 MCP server to look up any documentation you might need.
- Ensure your solution meets all the requirements.
- Ensure your solution is secure.
- Consider whether or not your changes would be best placed behind a feature flag.
- Be detailed in your plan but also succinct.
- Don't write any code yet. Just put your plan in a `Plan_from_Claude.md` file.
